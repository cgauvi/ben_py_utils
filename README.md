 ## Notes

 There is a github action to automatically generate the documentation by calling `mkdocs build` and pushing to a git-hub-pages branch. Otherwise, the documentation can be built manually, committed and pushed. The repo builds the pages using the `docs` folder so make sure that is the repo with the `index.html` file. See the `mkdocs.yml` file for details
